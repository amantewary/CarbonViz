# CarbonViz - A Web-Based Data Visualization for Carbon Dioxide Emission

CarbonViz is a web-based data visualization for monitoring CO2 Emissions, Emissions Per Capita and Emissions Per Dollar of GDP from year 1990 to 2011 and to provide its user with a comprehensive understanding of the change occurred across the globe.

CarbonViz is developed entirely using JavaScript that adopts HyperText Markup Language (HTML5) for handling rendering behavior of graphical elements. The styling of graphical elements is done using Cascaded Style Sheet (CSS3). D3.js , a JavaScript library, is used for manipulating Document Object Model (DOM) based on data. A third-party jQuery plugin â€“ One Page Scroll - is used for smooth navigation between different graphs.
